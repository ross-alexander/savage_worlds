name: James Robert Pentagast

description: |
  Youngest son of Albert Pentgast II, a blue blooded member of the
  Alabama aristocracy.

  After a youth of wine, women and horse racing he loses his early
  inheritance when the Confederacy army seizes his shipment of fine
  drinks off a train from New York.  His brother then marries his
  childhood sweetheart and takes his finest horse as a ``wedding
  present''.

  After stealing back his horse he burns his brother's newly built
  family home to the ground and flees to Mexico.

  Now out for revenge against the Confederacy and the whole Southern
  Establishment.
